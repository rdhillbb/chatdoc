Unparalleled coverage, unmatched speed, unlimited insights
The legacy data infrastructure our industry has relied on for decades wasn’t built for today’s space race. That’s why we built a new one. With LeoLabs Vertex™, our vertically integrated space operations stack, we have drastically increased the coverage, speed, and insights powering innovation in low Earth orbit. Our goal is to be the sole provider of truly integrated, superior information — the key to operational success in today’s space race.










Our values








 Lead by learning 
 We’re committed to life-long learning, which enables us to identify the need for change when it arises and reward each other for trying new things. 









 Trust and transparency 
 We believe trust is impossible without transparency. Stronger, more effective teams emerge when people are honest and open. 










 Work fast and have fun 
 We’re fast-paced. We’re quickly developing new solutions in response to the market — but we also know when to come up for air and have fun. 









 Think globally; be grounded 
 We’re addressing a global problem that transcends boundaries. Our solution is also global, grounded in science, pragmatism, and data. 



 





Our global presence 
We have offices in several different locations and employees 
spread across multiple time zones and continents.








Meet our leadership team
LeoLabs is led by a team of experts with deep experience in the space and technology industries. Our
executive team has flown 3 missions to LEO, built 5 radars, built 10 satellite payloads, run two scientific 
observatories, launched a new programming language, and served on console for multiple launches.
